            <p>
              Coffee is at the absolute core of our business and we believe that
              great coffee has the power to create positive change. We make
              careful choices about the coffee we buy, working with the
              Rainforest Alliance to source our famous beans to their high
              standard.

            <p>
              We ensure that 100% of our coffee beans come from Rainforest
              Alliance Certified farms. This means that for every cup of coffee
              we serve, we invest back into the coffee-growing communities we
              depend on.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              At present, due to global supply chain disruptions, we are
              temporarily unable to source enough certified coffee with the
              Rainforest Alliance seal to maintain 100% coverage in our stores,
              Costa Express, and Ready to Drink and At Home ranges. These
              products continue to contain at least 70% Rainforest Alliance
              Certified coffee ingredients.
              <br />
              <br />
              We'll return to sourcing all our coffee from Rainforest Alliance
              Certified farms as soon as these disruptions ease. Find out more
