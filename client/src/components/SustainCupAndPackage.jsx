            <h2>Cup recycling</h2>
            <p>
              Currently, coffee cups are not accepted in household recycling
              collections in the UK. They must be collected separately and sent
              to one of four specialized paper recycling facilities within the
              country for sorting and recycling.
            </p>

            <p>
              <div className="inline-right cup_n_package--recycling_image"></div>
              We made recycling coffee cups easier by introducing recycling
              points in all our stores. Now, customers can recycle any paper
              takeaway cup . We accept cups of any brand to ensure they are
              properly recycled.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not satisfied with stopping there, just two years later we
              partnered with
              <a href="https://www.valpak.co.uk/"> Valpak </a>
              (an independent waste management service company) to launch the
              UK’s
              <a href="https://www.cuprecyclingscheme.co.uk/">
                National Cup Recycling Scheme
              </a>
              . Through this scheme, we pay waste collectors an incentive for
              every tonne of cups they collect, which helps to fund the right
              infrastructure and processes for cups to be recovered for
              recycling.So far, the scheme has helped to recycle over 190
              million cups and has resulted in more places like offices,
              shopping centres, universities, transport hubs and local councils
              provide cup recycling facilities. We are also thrilled that the
              scheme is now supported by more of the UK’s leading coffee brands,
              as we know that collaborating is the best way to increase
              recycling rates.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are determined to recycle as many cups as possible, and we will
              continue to roll out dedicated cup recycling points to all our
              stores across 2024.

            <h2>Innovative cup design</h2>
            <p>
              As part of an ongoing effort to reduce the environmental impact of
              our iconic takeaway cups, in November 2021 we changed the inside
              lining to plant-based plastic.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also replaced our plastic straws with a paper-based alternative
              and in Autumn 2023 launched our new recyclable fibre lid for our
              hot takeaway drinks in stores in Wales and Belgium. Available
              across small, medium and large drinks sizes, the lids are made
              from renewable plant-based material and are plastic free. They can
              be recycled together with the cups in any of our stores.
