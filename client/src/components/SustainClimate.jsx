            <h2>Tackling climate change to keep the world's cup full</h2>
            <p>
              Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. The science
              is clear: to avoid its very worst effects, we need to limit global
              warming to 1.5C.
            </p>
            <p>
              To play our part in tackling climate change, we need to think and
              act boldly. The targets we’ve set ourselves are significant;
              they'll drive us to genuinely change the way we do business,
              globally.

            <h2>Our path to Net Zero</h2>
            <p>
              Our starting point was to understand the carbon footprint of our
              entire global business, including our supply chains. By building
              this map of where our carbon emissions come from, we are better
              able to understand where we should be focusing our attention in
              the years to come.

              In July 2020 we were delighted to be one of the 20 UK retailers to
              join the British Retail Consortium’s ‘Climate Roadmap’ as a
              founding signatory. This roadmap includes a commitment to tackle
              climate change that will accelerate the UK’s progress to becoming
              Net Zero, ahead of the Government’s 2050 target.
            </p>
            <p>
              In March 2022 we launched our new, ambitious carbon reduction
              targets across our global business. Our initial focus is to reduce
              our emissions by 50% per coffee serving: our 2030 target, approved
              by the experts at the{" "}
              <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org">
                Science Based Targets initiative
              </a>
              . Once we achieve this, we’ll continue to reduce emissions even
              further (as much as we possibly can), before investing in
              innovative programmes to offset the small amount of challenging
              emissions that remain. This will help us to achieve our ultimate
              ambition: to be Net Zero by 2040.

              Our carbon mapping work showed us that 95% of our carbon footprint
              is what’s known as ‘Scope 3’ – the emissions created when our
              products are grown or produced, transported, prepared and
              consumed. This means one of the most important actions we can take
              is to work in partnership with the suppliers who source our most
              important and iconic products: coffee beans, milk and food. You
              can find out more about our work with Rainforest Alliance and our
              milk suppliers{" "}

              We are always trying to improve the energy efficiency of our
              stores, for example by investing in new equipment and LED
              lighting. One of the ways that we have been able to test new
              efficiencies in our stores is through the construction of four
              ‘Eco Pod’ stores, for example at Parc Tawe, Swansea and Wrekin
              Retail Park, Telford.
